# NestedMonteCarlo

Quite a mess around there. All those files are linked with Nested Monte Carlo Method :

 - Binary Trees project
 - Chemical Benchmark
 - cpp attempt for Tristan's test specifications
 - csv file for Tristan's test specifications made by Emerick
 - py under construction attempt for Tristan's test specifications 
 
 ## Binary Trees project
 
 ## Chemical Benchmark
 
 ## cpp attempt for Tristan's test specifications 
 
 Doesn't work and lacks the csv file loading. It builds its own boards.
 
 ## py under construction attempt
 
  Doesn't work and lacks the csv file loading. It builds its own boards and is ispired by the cpp attempt
