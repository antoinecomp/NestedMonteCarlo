Hour exam #3, Spring 2001
Question 5

While the instructions require starting materials to contain fewer than 3 carbon atoms, the course solution uses pentadiene, which contains 5 carbons so we provide pentadiene as a starting material. 

PhMgBr can be made from PhBr, which is made by electrophilic aromatic substitution on benzene (a permitted starting material).

Our solution performs Grignard addition to an acid chloride rather than an ester.
